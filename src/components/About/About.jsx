            I am interested in pursuing a career in technology because it allows
            me to use my creative and analytical skills in a meaningful way. I
            really appreciate that I will be able to build upon these skills
            while also learning new skills every day! I am also interested in
            being a part of an industry that has changed many lives and still
            continues to do so.
            <br />
            <br />
            As I mentioned, the ability to make a change and use my skills in a
            meaningful way motivates me to pursue this career path, especially
            as a black woman in STEM. Due to the industry being predominantly
            white, there is alot of conscious and unconscious bias that takes
            place in the creation of applications, products, etcâ€¦ I would like
            to use myself as a way to make people more aware of these biases and
            create projects that are more inclusive of everyone not just one
            group of people.
